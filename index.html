	    	<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p> I got my first job at 15 on a workers permit and I am still working there in a management role. I have had 4 cars already in my lifetime. I blew up the motor in one, someone crashed into the other, I got rid of one, and now I currently drive a 2024 Kia Forte GT. I have one older brother who has two kids and a wife who I hang out with alot when i'm not working. My current major is not the one I chose when I applied to Lewis. I was originally going into the flight program but I found out I couldn't fly planes anymore. So now that i'm in Aviation Administration I want to eventually work for the FAA and hopefully be a big influence in regulations. </p>

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>A fun fact about me is that all senior year of highschool is was doing flight training to become a private pilot. I was so so close to getting my license however I found out I have a rare heart problem that the FAA deems as an "unfit" medical condition. This is the reason im an Aviation Administration major and not trying to become a pilot because I still have so much love for the aviation industry</p>
