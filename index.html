            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>A fun fact about me is that all senior year of highschool is was doing flight training to become a private pilot. I was so so close to getting my license however I found out I have a rare heart problem that the FAA deems as an "unfit" medical condition. This is the reason im an Aviation Administration major and not trying to become a pilot because I still have so much love for the aviation industry</p>
